# Goal Symmetry Spread Comparison: 0.8% vs 3.3%

## Quick Answer

**0.8% spread is "better"** for identifying high draw likelihood matches.

**Lower spread = More balanced = Higher draw likelihood**

---

## Direct Comparison

### 0.8% Spread

**Example:**
- Home Win: **38.5%**
- Away Win: **37.7%**
- **Difference: 0.8%** ← Very balanced

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Extremely balanced** match
- ✅ **Very high structural draw likelihood**
- ✅ Teams are **almost perfectly matched**
- ✅ **Maximum uncertainty** (coin-flip scenario)
- ✅ Draw probability likely **>30%**

**Interpretation:**
- This is a **true coin-flip match**
- Draw is **very likely** due to team balance
- **Hardest to predict** (high entropy)

---

### 3.3% Spread

**Example:**
- Home Win: **38.2%**
- Away Win: **34.9%**
- **Difference: 3.3%** ← Still balanced

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Balanced** match (still triggers draw pressure message)
- ✅ **High structural draw likelihood**
- ✅ Teams are **well-matched**
- ✅ Draw probability likely **>25%**

**Interpretation:**
- This is a **balanced match** with slight home edge
- Draw is **likely** due to team balance
- **Moderately hard to predict**

## Which Is "Better"?

### For Draw Likelihood: **0.8% is Better**

| Metric | 0.8% Spread | 3.3% Spread | Winner |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Balance** | Extremely balanced | Well-balanced | **0.8%** ✅ |
| **Draw Likelihood** | Very high (>30%) | High (>25%) | **0.8%** ✅ |
| **Uncertainty** | Maximum | High | **0.8%** ✅ |
| **Team Match** | Almost perfect | Good | **0.8%** ✅ |
| **Predictability** | Hardest | Hard | **0.8%** ✅ |

**Conclusion:** **0.8% spread indicates a stronger draw signal** than 3.3%.

## Why Lower Spread = Higher Draw Likelihood

### Mathematical Explanation

When `P(Home) ≈ P(Away)` (low spread):

1. **Goal Expectations Are Balanced**
   - `λ_home ≈ λ_away`
   - More likely to end in equal scores (0-0, 1-1, 2-2, etc.)

2. **Probability Mass Concentrates on Draw**
   - When home and away are close, draw probability is **structurally elevated**
   - This is a property of the probability distribution

3. **Teams Cancel Each Other Out**
   - Balanced teams → balanced play → more draws

### Visual Comparison

**0.8% Spread:**
```
Home: 38.5%  |  Draw: 30.0%  |  Away: 37.7%
     ↑              ↑              ↑
  Almost equal probabilities → High draw likelihood
```

**3.3% Spread:**
```
Home: 38.2%  |  Draw: 27.0%  |  Away: 34.9%
     ↑              ↑              ↑
  Slightly imbalanced → Still high draw, but less than 0.8%
```

## Practical Implications

### For Ticket Construction

**0.8% Spread Match:**
- ✅ **Strong candidate for draw inclusion**
- ✅ Use **draw-enhanced sets** (Set D, Set E)
- ✅ **High priority** for draw coverage
- ✅ Consider **multiple draw picks** if allowed

**3.3% Spread Match:**
- ✅ **Good candidate for draw inclusion**
- ✅ Use **draw-enhanced sets** (Set D, Set E)
- ✅ **Medium priority** for draw coverage
- ✅ **One draw pick** is sufficient

## Thresholds

### Spread Categories

| Spread Range | Category | Draw Likelihood | Action |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **< 1%** | **Extremely Balanced** | **Very High (>30%)** | **Maximum draw priority** |
| **1-3%** | **Very Balanced** | **High (>28%)** | **High draw priority** |
| **3-5%** | **Balanced** | **Elevated (>25%)** | **Medium draw priority** |
| **5-10%** | **Slightly Imbalanced** | **Moderate (20-25%)** | **Low draw priority** |
| **> 10%** | **Imbalanced** | **Low (<20%)** | **Minimal draw priority** |

### Your Examples

- **0.8% spread** → **Extremely Balanced** → **Very High draw likelihood**
- **3.3% spread** → **Balanced** → **Elevated draw likelihood**

Both are good for draw inclusion, but **0.8% is stronger**.

## Real-World Example

### Match 1: 0.8% Spread

**Arsenal vs Liverpool**
- Home Win: **38.5%**
- Draw: **30.2%**
- Away Win: **37.7%**
- **Spread: 0.8%**

**Analysis:**
- Teams are **almost perfectly matched**
- Draw probability is **very high** (30.2%)
- This is a **coin-flip match**
- **Strong draw candidate**

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Include draw** in ticket
- ✅ Use **Set D (Draw-Boosted)** or **Set E (Entropy-Penalized)**
- ✅ **High confidence** in draw likelihood

---

### Match 2: 3.3% Spread

**Man City vs Chelsea**
- Home Win: **38.2%**
- Draw: **27.5%**
- Away Win: **34.9%**
- **Spread: 3.3%**

**Analysis:**
- Teams are **well-matched** (slight home edge)
- Draw probability is **elevated** (27.5%)
- This is a **balanced match**
- **Good draw candidate**

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Include draw** in ticket
- ✅ Use **Set D (Draw-Boosted)** or **Set E (Entropy-Penalized)**
- ✅ **Medium confidence** in draw likelihood

## Summary

### Answer to Your Question

**"When spread is less, e.g., 0.8% vs 3.3%, which is better?"**

**Answer: 0.8% spread is "better" for draw likelihood.**

**Reasoning:**
- Lower spread = More balanced teams
- More balanced = Higher structural draw likelihood
- 0.8% indicates **extremely balanced** match
- 3.3% indicates **balanced** match (still good, but less than 0.8%)

### Key Takeaway

**Lower spread = Higher draw likelihood**

**Rule of thumb:**
- **< 1% spread** → **Maximum draw priority**
- **1-3% spread** → **High draw priority**
- **3-5% spread** → **Medium draw priority**

Both 0.8% and 3.3% are excellent for draw inclusion, but **0.8% is stronger**.

## Action Items

### For 0.8% Spread Matches:
1. ✅ **Prioritize draw inclusion**
2. ✅ Use **draw-enhanced probability sets**
3. ✅ Consider **multiple draw picks** if strategy allows
4. ✅ **High confidence** in draw likelihood

### For 3.3% Spread Matches:
1. ✅ **Include draw** in ticket
2. ✅ Use **draw-enhanced probability sets**
3. ✅ **One draw pick** is sufficient
4. ✅ **Medium confidence** in draw likelihood

---

## Conclusion

**0.8% spread > 3.3% spread** for draw likelihood identification.

Both are excellent signals for draw inclusion, but **0.8% indicates a stronger draw signal** due to the extreme balance between teams.

**Remember:** Lower spread = More balanced = Higher draw likelihood.
